Each instance of an NPC and instance of a Store has access to its own instance of a wallet
A wallet receives and holds an integer, representing the number of copper pieces inside of the wallet
An array stores the number of non-copper coins the wallet contains
    By default, the wallet attempts to create as many large-value coins as possible
    Platinum and Electrum are ignored by default and must be manually given to the wallet
    This array is returned when the balance of a wallet is displayed (copper value is displayed after in parentheses)
